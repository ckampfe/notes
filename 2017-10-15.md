{:tags #{"clojure" "clojurescript" "javascript" "npm"}}

Past few days, worked on `cljs-exe` a bit to tighten up the build.boot API, bump the `nexe` version, and remove the dependency on `yarn`.

Clojurescript crucially added support for npm dependency resultion, like:

```clojure
(task-options! cljs {:compiler-options
                     {:npm-deps {:nexe "2.0.0-rc.11"}
                      :install-deps true}})
```

Nice!

I still have to update the generated README to indicate the changes.
